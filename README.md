## Scoring-tasks

The scoring is based on three main areas: 
- Team engagement
- Technical chops
- Presentation

Here's the activities which will grant your team points (feel free to recommend more):

_Social_

* Naming your team
* Sending a tweet with a picture of your team and team name to the #PGHLittleHack hashtag
* Extra points if you tag everyone in your team in that tweet!
* Meet five people you didn't know before today and trade stickers
* Create in the PGHLittleHack Github repo a text file with your Team name, members and project
* Bringing beer to team members

_Technical_

* Interact with a public API (any method)
* Interact with a public API using a "modern language" such as Python, Ansible, Terraform, etc
* Create a sub-repository or team project page and add your code

_Presentation_

* Had a clear objective
* Can detail what each team member brought to the project
* Create a presentation 
* Use memes in the presentation (Ariel has something special if you use cats!)
* Did not use Comic Sans

## Toys

*Confirmed lab gear and technology you can play with*

- Eric Nielsen will have Raspebrry Pi and sensors handy  
- Expedient is offering access to their [vCloud environment](https://twitter.com/anthonydjackman/status/1131031022949289984)! And they will be in attendance to help people use it. **Send Ariel Sanchez a DM with 4 things - first name, last name, work email, company. They won't spam you, but it's needed for this generous gesture.**  This is great if you don't have a clear idea of what you want to build but know you will need some infrastructure.
- Ariel Sanchez will bring a 64gb NUC, Open vSwitch switch, and a VeloCloud device
- AdminWillie has a Pi with contollers.
- Tim Borland has a vRA + NSX-T environment, open to working on things involving API/Terraform/etc.
